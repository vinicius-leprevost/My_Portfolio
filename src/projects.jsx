                        As the founder and lead developer of Piazada RP, I designed and implemented a custom FiveM server aimed at
                        providing an immersive and dynamic roleplay experience. The server is built on the VRPX/VRPEX architecture
                        and includes advanced systems such as a custom economy using virtual currency ("Piazada Coins"), job hierarchies,
                        and unique roleplay mechanics tailored to create a robust in-game world.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The server features a sophisticated drift system and a rarity-based item drop system, both of which were developed
                        to enhance user engagement and provide deeper layers of interaction. In addition to game mechanics, I focused on
                        creating a community-driven environment where users could interact within an organized framework, simulating
                        real-life scenarios. This project involved backend development, server optimization, and community management.
